def weighted_loss(loss_func):
    """Create a weighted version of a given loss function.

    To use this decorator, the loss function must have the signature like
    `loss_func(pred, target, **kwargs)`. The function only needs to compute
    element-wise loss without any reduction. This decorator will add weight
    and reduction arguments to the function. The decorated function will have
    the signature like `loss_func(pred, target, weight=None, reduction='mean',
    avg_factor=None, **kwargs)`.

    :Example:

    >>> @weighted_loss
    >>> def l1_loss(pred, target):
    >>>     return (pred - target).abs()

    >>> pred = torch.Tensor([0, 2, 3])
    >>> target = torch.Tensor([1, 1, 1])
    >>> weight = torch.Tensor([1, 0, 1])

    >>> l1_loss(pred, target)
    tensor(1.3333)
    >>> l1_loss(pred, target, weight)
    tensor(1.)
    >>> l1_loss(pred, target, reduction='none')
    tensor([1., 1., 2.])
    >>> l1_loss(pred, target, weight, avg_factor=2)
    tensor(1.5000)
